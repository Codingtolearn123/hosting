# Hostinger Homepage Replica

A static, responsive recreation of the Hostinger.com homepage. The layout mirrors the primary marketing sections including the hero offer, domain search, hosting solution highlights, WordPress and builder promos, migration CTA, global data centers, testimonials, FAQ, and a multi-column footer.

## Preview locally
Open `index.html` in any modern browser (double-click or drag it into a window) to explore the page. No build tools are required—the only remote asset is the Google Fonts import.

## Project structure
- `index.html` – semantic markup for all homepage sections and navigation
- `styles/main.css` – gradient-rich, glassmorphism-inspired styling with responsive layouts and mobile navigation states
- `scripts/main.js` – domain search toast interaction, mobile menu toggle, and footer year helper

Feel free to customize the copy, imagery, or pricing to match your needs, or integrate the markup into a templating system or CMS.
